                                To achieve the goal of generating variant utterances under the same semantic frames, the input utterance is converted into its delexicalised form with its slot values replaced by labels, and then generating its delexicalised variances with a seq2seq model. Finally, surface realization is carried out to convert the delexicalised form into the raw utterance. Used BERT for next step classification to remove false positives, by matching the intents of the output with the input and achieved multiplication rate of 2, i.e., generating 2 utterances for every utterance in the training set.

                                Implemented a system to suggest dialogs to drive the conversation forward with the user. For example, suggesting the user to “Book an Uber” when he asks his “Direction to work”. Implemented the system as a multi label classification problem which used the user’s utterance as input to the sequence to sequence model where every step of the decoder was used to generate labels/next intent of the user. These intents were further used to suggest dialogs. Training data being less, achieved an improvement in F1-score of 5% on using pre-trained BERT as encoder and fine-tuning it with the training data.

                                Predicting future opinions of users in a social network by considering the influence of its friends. Used network-guided recurrent neural networks to model the time and frequency of the opinions of the users as opinion dynamics has an inherent recursive structure depending on past opinions. Achieved an improvement of 10% in the MSE of the predicted opinions over previous state-of-the-art models as the non-linearities of RNNs captured the opinion exchange process concretely.

                                Commbox is a real time commentory box which uses machine learning techniques and real time sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope) from wearable devices. It analyses the sound of the ball hitting the bat by distinguishing it from any other sound by fixing a threshold of the sound intensity to start recording the data from the wearable devices which then goes into a classifier to predict the shot played. The project recieved the best demo paper award at COMSNETS'17. Paper titled <span style="font-style:italic">Learning Non Linear Opinion Dynamics in Social Networks</span> accepted in International Conference on Data Mining(ICDM'17).

                                Developing on-board automotive driver assistance systems for detecting environments to help the drivers and also applications in autonomous driving . We focus on assisting the driver or the autonomous vehicle to either turn left, right or go straight by the images that it captures from its front camera. Images collected from the popular video game <i>Road Rash</i> for Up, Right, Left through logging key press events. Applied AlexNet architecture based on Convolutional Neural Networks for classifying the images.

                                Worked on a text summarisation task for automatic abstract generation for scientific documents. Converted the paper to paragraph embeddings using para2vec and trained a bidirectional sequence to sequence LSTM network with attention to capture the long-term dependencies in scientific papers. Achieved ROUGE-1 scores of 0.5. Although, results weren’t stunning, could show that LSTMs have the potential to work for long documents but require more computational power.

Compared the search results across various combinations of weights assigned to different parts of the paper (title, abstract, citation context) and used Tf-Idf and BM-25 to retrieve the papers. Used query expansion by expanding the query with similar words using word2vec. BM-25 with title given the highest priority performed the best among all with a MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rate) of 0.2 over a test-set of 1000 documents.
